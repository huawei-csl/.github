HUAWEI Computing Systems Lab

We use this space to work with and contribute to the open source community in the area of algorithms, software, and hardware to build better computing systems.

These repositories only contain code for papers and are **not** open source products. You can open issues and we will try to address them in a timely, but best-effort manner. You can also reach out to us by emailing the authors of the related papers. 
For Huawei's major open source projects that are officially maintained, please refer to https://github.com/huawei and http://opensource.huawei.com/.
